# Glipso

A basic Lisp written using Go to help me learn both Go and Lisp.

## Current Features

Glipso has *very few* features. So far it supports the following functions:

```
(= arg...)                  return true if all arguments are equal, otherwise false
(+ arg...)                  sum all arguments
(- arg...)                  minus all arguments from the first argument
(apply func list)           apply list of items as arguments to func
(cons arg list?)            add arg to beginning of list. If list is not provided then creates a new list
(def var exp)               set a variable in the global environment
(defn name [args] exp)      performs 'def' and 'fn' functions together
(defmacro name [args] exp)  performs 'def' and 'macro' functions together
(do exp...)                 run the expressions in order
(empty list)                returns true if a list is empty
(filter fn list)            filter out items in a list by applying fn to them and dropping false responses
(first list)                get first element in list
(fn [args] exp)             creates a function that accepts n arguments are an expression
(if test exp1 exp2)         if test is 'true' evaluate exp1, otherwise evaluate exp2
(last list)                 returns the last value in list
(lazypair a b)              returns a pair with head 'a' that will evaluate 'b' lazily to generate a tail
(let [arg pairs] exp)       creates a new scope for exp in which arg pairs have been evaluated and put into scope
(macro [args] exp)          creates a macro that will replace args in the exp with arguments provided for evaluation
(map fn list)               generate a new list by applying fn to each element in a list
(range start end)           creates a lazily evaluated list from start to end (inclusive)
(repeat item times)         returns a list consisting of times number of items 
(tail list)                 get tail of the list
(take num list)             returns a lazily evaluated list that is the first 'num' elements in 'list'
```

### Types

Glipso internally supports the following types:
```
I   integer
B   boolean
P   pair/list
EXP expression
REF reference
VEC Vector
S   String
```

### Example Code
```
	(do
		(def add1 (fn [a] (+ 1 a)))
		(add1 5)
	)
```

### Building
```bash
#run all tests
go test ./...

#build
go build

#test, build & run all acceptance tests
./precommit.sh

#benchmark acceptance tests
go test -bench=.
```

### Running
```bash
./glipso examples/summing-range.glipso

#or

echo "(+ 1 2 3)" | ./glipso
```

## Roadmap

In no particular order:

* implicit expression around parsed expressions to cope with multiple sequential expressions
* support some kind of HashMap datatype along with :symbols
* make `map` and `filter` functions work with lazy lists
* make list functions work on lazy, non-lazy and vector lists
* support for more datatypes, i.e. Decimal
* implement some goroutine support to push expressions onto other threads and receive notifications when complete
* improve macro implementation with better substitution options
